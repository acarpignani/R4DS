# R for Data Science

## The Bedford Sixth Form Enhancement Class

Welcome to the public repository of the enhancement class on R for Data Science offered at The Bedford Sixth Form. In this page you will find the list of all data set that are going to be used in the course, as well as useful information, and a brief note of all the topics covered in each lesson.

### Aim of this course

The aim of this course is to give a thorough and opinionated introduction to R using the magnificent IDE RStudio, to show how the program excellently performs data analysis on different data sets, to introduce to the use of the meta-package **tidyverse** to perform exploratory data analysis, clean and reshape the data, and to give an introduction to machine learning algorithms using the meta-package **tidymodels**.

In the second part of the course, when the students have acquired the basic syntax of R, the course will move onto an individual project in which every participant can collect suitable data and analyse the data to answer a statistical question on a topic of their choice, and write a full reproducible report to show their findings. The project may be published on RPubs and can be included in the student's portfolio, to show potential employers or to university their ability to use the software and to analyse data.

### Prerequisites to follow this course

This course has basically no prerequisites, except the notions of mathematics and statistics from any GCSE Mathematics course. In particular, the learner is assumed to know the following statistical tools: *mean*, *mode*, *median*, *range*, *interquartile range*, *box-and-whiskers plot*, *histogram*, *bar chart*. Any other statistical instrument that might be useful will be briefly recalled during the course.

### Install R and RStudio

-   To install R, it suffices to follow the link to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN) repository and to install R clicking on the **Download R for \<your-base-system\>.**

In this course we will also assume that you have installed the **RStudio** IDE. This open-source, integrated desktop environment makes it possible for all R users to have a common R interface, which is greatly enhanced over the R's basic command line interface.

-   Installation of RStudio is straightforward in most cases. The [RStudio web site](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) has links to the necessary files to download.

### Bibliography

I am adding below some websites that you might find useful to look for data.

1.  The [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/) (UCI Repository) contains lots of data sets that can be used to do machine learning.
2.  [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) is a project of the R community that aims to provide weekly real world data sets to tidy and analyse.
3.  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) is a great place to find little useful challenges to do. We shall see some of these challenges in our course, but you may always want to attempt one of them of your own. If there is a general consensus on a particular challenge, that could also be done as a team.
4.  [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) contains a wealth of data that can be analysed.

Also you may wish to check the little publications that I have made on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/acarpignani).
