# R for Data Science

## The Bedford Sixth Form Enhancement Class

Welcome to the public repository of the enhancement class on R for Data Science offered at The Bedford Sixth Form. In this page you will find the list of all data set that are going to be used in the course, as well as useful information, and a brief note of all the topics covered in each lesson.

### Aim of the course

The aim of this course is to give a thorough and opinionated introduction to R using the magnificent IDE RStudio, to show how the program excellently performs data analysis on different data sets, to introduce to the use of the meta-package **tidyverse** to perform exploratory data analysis, clean and reshape the data, and to give an introduction to machine learning algorithms using the meta-package **tidymodels**.

### Prerequisites to follow this course

This course has basically no prerequisites, except the notions of mathematics and statistics from any GCSE Mathematics course. In particular, the learner is assumed to know the following statistical tools: *mean*, *mode*, *median*, *range*, *interquartile range*, *box-and-whiskers plot*, *histogram*, *bar chart*. Any other statistical instrument that might be useful will be briefly introduced during the course.

### Install R and RStudio

-   To install R, it suffices to follow the link to the [Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/) (CRAN) repository and to install R clicking on the **Download R for \<your-base-system\>.**

In this course we will also assume that you have installed the **RStudio** IDE. This open-source, integrated desktop environment makes it possible for all R users to have a common R interface, which is greatly enhanced over the R's basic command line interface.

-   Installation of RStudio is straightforward in most cases. The [RStudio web site](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/) has links to the necessary files to download.
